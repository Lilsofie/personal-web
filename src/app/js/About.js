                Hi, I’m Kate Huang, a 3rd-year computer science student at the University of Toronto, passionate about cloud computing, web technologies and security. 
                I enjoy developing innovative projects, exploring new technologies, and using programming to solve practical issues. 
                I've worked on a Literature Search Engine as the backend and database engineer and am proficient in Python, React and Neo4j Database. 
                Outside of technology, I enjoy street dancing and snowboarding. Let’s connect on LinkedIn to collaborate or chat!
